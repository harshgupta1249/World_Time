# World_Time Flutter App
Created a **Flutter App** that shows the time of a place that can be selected from the given list of locations.<br>
According to the current time of a place, background image switches between day and night.<br>
Used the WorldTimeAPI (http://worldtimeapi.org/) for getting time.<br>
